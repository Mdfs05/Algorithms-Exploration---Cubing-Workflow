# Algorithms-Exploration---Cubing-Workflow
## You will consider the cube your data set and your mind and body as the computer. Each day you will pick a twisty puzzle ("cube"), set a goal for yourself, work towards that goal, then record progress for yourself.

### __Current Abilities:__
- **Pyraminx Duo** (Can solve using the 'in, in, out, out' [R' L R L'] algorithim, as seen in Z3Cubing's video on how to solve a pyraminx duo)
  + Ao5 (8.52 seconds - Achieved on 10/21/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao12 (8.81 seconds - Achieved on 10/21/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao25 (9.09 seconds - Achieved on 10/21/2022 [VALIDATED])

- **Pyraminx** (Using Noah Richardson's method from his tutorial to solve it, but instead I have taken 3 algorithims from the tutorial to solve the pyraminx)
  + Ao5 (43.93 seconds - Achieved on 10/14/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao12 (38.30 seconds - Achieved on 10/17/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao25 (32.66 seconds - Achieved on 10/17/2022 [VALIDATED])
  
- **2x2** (Using JPerm's beginner's method to solve)
  + Ao5 (1:54.92 minutes - Achieved on 10/20/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao12 (1:26.36 minutes - Achieved on 10/20/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao25 (1:24.26 minutes - Achieved on 10/20/2022 [VALIDATED])
  
- **3x3** (Using JPerm's beginner's method to solve, with some slight modifications for solving the white cross and some improvements to increase the effciency of inseeting corners of layers)
  + Ao5 (2:03.40 minutes - Achieved on 10/20/2022 [VALIDATED])
  + Ao12 (1:57.30 minutes - Achieved on 10/20/2022 [VALIDATED])
