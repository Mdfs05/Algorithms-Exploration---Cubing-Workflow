# Algorithms-Exploration---Cubing-Workflow
## You will consider the cube your data set and your mind and body as the computer. Each day you will pick a twisty puzzle ("cube"), set a goal for yourself, work towards that goal, then record progress for yourself.

My journey in cubing began in grade 9 when I learned how to solve the **pyramid duo**, but then when I later tried to learn how to solve the pyraminx, I was unable to. Then fast forward to this year, I had learned how to solve the **pyraminx** using Noah Richardsonâ€™s tutorial that had been modified into 3 simple algorithms. Though before this, I came across the problem of special cases where I was unsure of what algorithm to use, where I was taught by my friend Michael how to solve from them by replacing pieces to set up for an algorithim for a solve. For the **3x3** I was able to learn how to solve the first 2 layers on the day after I started learning how to solve it. I came across the problem of having difficulty wrapping my head around the last layer of the 3x3, aka the yellow face. So, the next day, with the help of my sister, I learned how to solve the **2x2**. Learning to solve the 2x2 taught me key strategies such as movements needed for solving the last layer, with the movement being identical for the 3x3. As well as where the pieces needed to be in order to insert them correctly. So, the same day I learned to solve the 2x2, I learned how to solve the 3x3 with an average time of ~3:30 minutes. The day after that, though, I was able to optimize my 3x3 solve by choosing the face of attack to insert pieces (what side I faced while inserting time). This brought down my time considerably from around 3:30 minutes to around 2:00 minutes. After learning how to solve these 3 puzzles, I relaized how much they all had in common in terms of algorithims and methods. This reminds me of algorithms in programs used by computers to carry out tasks, which can have a lot of similiarities to each other in order to carry out a goal. My progress through the puzzles and my issues can be seen in the issues and projects tabs.
